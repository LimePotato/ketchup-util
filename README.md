# Ketchup Util

A util to aid me in modding.

### Requirements:
- Minecraft 1.19.2
- [Quilt Mod Loader](https://quiltmc.org)
- [Quilted Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl)
- [Ketchup Util](https://github.com/LimePotato/ketchup-util/releases)
- [Latest Release](https://github.com/LimePotato/Sine-Termino/releases)
###

These are just a few ideas, and you may come up with other names that you like better. The important thing is to choose a name that reflects the theme and content of your mod, and that fits the style of other Fabric and Quilt mods."
